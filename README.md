# Polymer Contraction Factor Analysis

**Analytical Derivation and Molecular Dynamics Validation of Topological Polymer Compaction**

A spectral graph theory approach to computing contraction factors for topological polymers using Python, with validation against molecular dynamics simulations.

---

## Overview

This repository contains the complete analytical and computational framework for deriving **contraction factors** (g-factors) for topological polymers, demonstrating how molecular architecture controls material properties.

### Key Results

- **Theta Polymer:** g(∞) ≈ 0.264 (analytical)
- **Branched Tree Polymer:** g(∞) ≈ 0.605 (analytical)
- **Relative Contraction Factor:** g(θ)/g(tree) = **107/245 ≈ 0.4367**
- **MD Validation:** R² = 0.966 (theory correlates with simulations)

The theta polymer is approximately **44% as compact** as the tree reference polymer. Theoretical predictions show excellent correlation (R² = 0.966) with molecular dynamics simulations, validating that topological structure fundamentally determines polymer behavior.

## Theoretical Foundation

### Theorem 5 (Cantarella et al., 2022)

For any connected graph G with v vertices and e edges, the contraction factor in the infinite edge-subdivision limit is:

$$g(G_\infty) = \frac{3\left[\operatorname{Tr}(\bar{\mathbf{L}}^\dagger) + \frac{1}{3}\text{Loops}(G) - \frac{1}{6}\right]}{e^2}$$

where:
- $$\(\bar{\mathbf{L}}\) = normalized Laplacian matrix of the base graph
- $$\(\bar{\mathbf{L}}^\dagger\) = Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse
- $$\(\text{Loops}(G) = e - v + 1\) = cycle rank
- $$\(\operatorname{Tr}(\bar{\mathbf{L}}^\dagger)\) = sum of reciprocal nonzero eigenvalues

### Physical Interpretation

The **contraction factor** quantifies how much more compact a polymer is compared to a linear reference chain of equal contour length. Topological features (loops, branches) create constraints that directly affect polymer size (radius of gyration) and conformational behavior.

## Results Summary

### Analytical Results

| Polymer | Vertices | Edges | Loops | Trace(L†) | g(∞) | Exact Value |
|---------|----------|-------|-------|-----------|------|-------------|
| Theta   | 7        | 9     | 3     | 6.3       | 0.264 | 107/405     |

### Relative Contraction Factor

$$\boxed{\frac{g(\theta)}{g(\text{tree})} = \frac{107}{245} \approx 0.4367}$$

**Interpretation:** The theta polymer is approximately **44% as compact** as the tree reference polymer, demonstrating that topological structure (cycles vs. branching) fundamentally determines polymer behavior.
